Welcome to my web page.

I'm Joseph Spearritt, a software developer based in Sydney, Australia.

I presently work for a large software company as a senior cloud infrastructure engineer, 
attempting and occasionally succeeding to make AWS do the thing I want.

I don't do a lot of development work in my personal time, but in the past I worked on 
some game modding for Tribes: Ascend. You can find some information on that at
https://www.tamods.org/.

I'm generally not interested in unsolicited services or offers, but if necessary you can 
contact me at my email, which is `joseph` at this domain.
